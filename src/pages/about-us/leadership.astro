        Schulter and Genevieve (“Jenny”) Etyang are the founders of
        <span class="font-medium">The Life Place</span>, Craigavon AH, Sandton, South Africa.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fifteen years ago, they encountered the good news of who Jesus is and what He has done, which became the central mission of their lives: inviting others to
        <span class="text-brand-red italic">Come. See. Jesus</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        They hold qualifications from TeamWork Bible College and Team Impact Christian University and were ordained by Joy Ministries, Lambton, Johannesburg, South Africa.
        Genevieve is a banker by profession.
      </p>

      <p>
        Married for fourteen years, the Etyangs enjoy conversations about Jesus, being at home, travelling, exercise, watching sports, Netflix and chill, and the simple things in life.
      </p>
