  <p>
    Schulter and Genevieve ("Jenny”) Etyang are the founders of
    <span class="font-medium">The Life Place</span> Craigavon AH, Sandton, South Africa.
  </p>

  <p>
   Fifteen years ago, they encountered the good news of who Jesus is and what he has done, which became the central mission of their lives: inviting others to
    <span class="text-brand-red italic">Come. See. Jesus</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They hold qualifications from TeamWork Bible College, Team Impact Christian University and ordained by Joy Ministries, Lambton, Johannesburg, South Africa.  
    Genevieve is a banker by profession.
  </p>

  <p>
   Married for fourteen years, the Etyangs enjoy conversations about Jesus, enjoy being at home, travelling, exercise, watching sports, Netflix and chill and the simple things in life.
